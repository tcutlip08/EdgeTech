          my mind. Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like. Bagpipes
          from Baghdad. Somebody turn the vacancy sign on. 'Cause I'm gone,
          blowing on my. Bagpipes from Baghdad. I run the streets. And act like
          a madman holding a Glad.I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God.
          All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now who thinks
          their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?. Let me show you
          maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard. Everybody want the
          key and the secret. To rap immortality like I have got.Mom, I know I
          let you down. And though you say the days are happy. Why is the power
          off and I'm fucked up?. And, Mom, I know he's not around. But don't
          you place the blame on me. As you pour yourself another drink, yeah. I
          guess we are who we are. Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive
          on. Maybe we took this too far.

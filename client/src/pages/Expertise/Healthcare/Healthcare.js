          I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter.
          But I thought a song would probably be a little better. Instead of a
          ,letter. That you'd probably just shred up--yeah. I stumbled on your
          picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of. How much of a
          waste it'd ,be for me to put some ink to, a stupid piece a. Paper, I'd
          rather let you see how. Much I fucking hate you in a freestyle.I’m the
          American Dream. I’m the definiton of white trash ballin’. I’m right
          back on 'em. With a (chicka chicka chicka) I can’t call it. Same shit,
          different toilet. Oh, you got a nice ass, darling. Can’t wait to get
          you into my Benz, take you for a spin. What you mean we ain't fuckin’?
          You take me for a friend?. Let me tell you the whole story of Shady’s
          origin.I'm not afraid to take a stand. Everybody, come take my hand.
          We'll walk this road together, through the storm. Whatever weather,
          cold or warm. Just lettin' you know that you're not alone. Holla if
          you feel like you've been down the same road.

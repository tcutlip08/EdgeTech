          My tea's gone cold. I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all. The
          morning rain clouds up my window. And I can't see at all. And even if
          I could it'd all be gray. But your picture on my wall. It reminds me
          that it's not so bad, it's not so bad.We're gonna rock this house
          until we knock it down. So turn the volume loud. 'Cause it's mayhem
          'til the A.M.. So, baby, make just like K-Fed. And let yourself go,
          let yourself go. Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket. Life's too
          short to not go for broke. So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab
          your vial, yeah.When you walked through the door. It was clear to me
          (Clear to me). You’re the one they adore. Who they came to see (Who
          they came to see). You’re a rock star (Baby). Everybody wants you
          (Everybody wants you). Player, who can really blame you? (Who can
          really blame you?). We’re the ones who made you.

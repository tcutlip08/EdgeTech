          Bagpipes from Baghdad. What's going through my mind. Half the time,
          when I rhyme, or blowing up like. Bagpipes from Baghdad. Somebody turn
          the vacancy sign on. 'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my. Bagpipes from
          Baghdad. I run the streets. And act like a madman holding a Glad.I'm
          beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the
          front to the back nod, back nod. The way I'm racing around the track,
          call me NASCAR, NASCAR. Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White
          Trash God. Kneel before General Zod. This planet's Krypton â€“ no,
          Asgard, Asgard.Feminist women love Eminem. "Chicka, chicka, chicka,

          you-know-what. Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute
          though.". Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose.

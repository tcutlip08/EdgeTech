              So bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad. Guarantee I’ll be the
              greatest thing you ever had. ‘Cause you ain't never met nobody
              like me. And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again. I'ma
              make you learn to appreciate me, differentiate me. From these
              phony, little fishy and sissy fake G’s. Skip over the "huggy
              bear," and all the "kissy face," please.I've created a monster,
              ‘cause nobody wants to. See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm
              chopped liver. Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya.
              A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor. Some vodka
              that'll jump start my heart quicker. Than a shock when I get
              shocked at the hospital.My tea's gone cold. I'm wondering why I
              got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window. And I
              can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray. But your
              picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not
              so bad.

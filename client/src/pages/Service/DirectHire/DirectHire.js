          So bad, I’m so good that I’m so bad. Guarantee I’ll be the greatest
          thing you ever had. ‘Cause you ain't never met nobody like me. And you
          ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again. I'ma make you learn to
          appreciate me, differentiate me. From these phony, little fishy and
          sissy fake G’s. Skip over the "huggy bear," and all the "kissy face,"
          please.I've created a monster, ‘cause nobody wants to. See Marshall no
          more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver. Well, if you want Shady,
          this is what I'll give ya. A little bit of weed mixed with some hard
          liquor. Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker. Than a shock
          when I get shocked at the hospital.My tea's gone cold. I'm wondering
          why I got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window. And
          I can't see at all. And even if I could it'd all be gray. But your
          picture on my wall. It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so
          bad.

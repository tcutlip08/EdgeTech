          We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down. So turn the volume
          loud. 'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.. So, baby, make just like
          K-Fed. And let yourself go, let yourself go. Say "Fuck it!" before we
          kick the bucket. Life's too short to not go for broke. So everybody,
          everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah.I was gonna take the time
          to sit down and write you a little letter. But I thought a song would
          probably be a little better. Instead of a ,letter. That you'd probably
          just shred up--yeah. I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made
          me stop and think of. How much of a waste it'd ,be for me to put some
          ink to, a stupid piece a. Paper, I'd rather let you see how. Much I
          fucking hate you in a freestyle.Feminist women love Eminem. "Chicka,
          chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him. Look at him, walkin'
          around, grabbin' his you-know-what. Flippin' the you-know-who," "Yeah,
          but he's so cute though.". Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up
          in my head loose. But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents'
          bedrooms.

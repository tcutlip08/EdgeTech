          meant to bring you to my world. Now you sitting in the corner crying.
          And now it's my fault, my fault.Can't you see what you do to me,
          baby?. You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac. I'm like a
          lunatic, you make me sick. You're truly the only one who can do this
          to me. You just make me get so crazy. I go schizo, I get so insane I
          just go schizophrenic. One minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I
          wanna sex.Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?. I repeat, will
          the real Slim Shady please stand up?. We're gonna have a problem here.
          Y'all act like you never seen a white person before. Jaws all on the
          floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door. And started whoopin'
          her ass worse than before.
